# Unilogik × Red Hat × Dynatrace × Carahsoft  
## Integrated Event-Driven Automation for Modern IT Operations

This document provides a professional, solution-oriented overview of how **Unilogik**, **Red Hat**, **Dynatrace**, and **Carahsoft** collaborate to deliver a unified, enterprise-grade automation and observability ecosystem powered by **Event-Driven Ansible (EDA)**.

---

## 1. Overview of the Joint Value Proposition

As organizations modernize infrastructure and adopt hybrid cloud architectures, they face increasing operational complexity: larger environments, more telemetry, and faster incident-response expectations. The joint capabilities of **Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform**, **Dynatrace**, **Unilogik Systems**, and **Carahsoft** deliver:

- **Real-time observability → automation pipelines**  
- **Automated incident remediation and compliance enforcement**  
- **Reduced mean time to detection (MTTD) and resolution (MTTR)**  
- **A fully supported procurement, deployment, and advisory ecosystem**

The partnership integrates **Dynatrace's AIOps and full-stack observability** with **Red Hat's Event-Driven Ansible** automation engine, delivered through **Unilogik’s engineering expertise** and enabled by **Carahsoft’s procurement and distribution infrastructure**.

## 2. Red Hat: Enterprise Automation with Event-Driven Ansible

Red Hat provides the **automation backbone** of the solution:

### Key Contributions
- **Event-Driven Ansible (EDA)**: Converts monitoring signals and business events into automated actions.  
- **Ansible Automation Platform (AAP)**: A scalable automation controller with governance, RBAC, execution environments, and centralized reporting.  
- **Rulebooks**: Declarative logic that maps events to automated responses (e.g., restart services, scale infrastructure, enrich alerts, update CMDB).  

### Strategic Role
Red Hat enables organizations to **standardize, automate, and orchestrate** infrastructure and application remediation, forming the operational engine that consumes real-time signals from Dynatrace.

## 3. Dynatrace: AI-Powered Observability and Precise Event Signals

Dynatrace provides the **event intelligence** that powers EDA.

### Key Contributions
- **Davis® AI**: Automated problem detection, root-cause analysis, and impact mapping.  
- **Full-stack observability**: Infrastructure, applications, user experience, and cloud-native workloads.  
- **High-quality, enriched event streams**: Dynatrace sends structured alerts and problem events via webhook or API, ideal for EDA rulebooks.  

### Strategic Role
Dynatrace is the **trusted event source** that generates **reliable, noise-reduced, context-rich alerts**, ensuring that Ansible automation executes only when meaningful problems occur.

## 4. Unilogik Systems: Deployment, Integration & Advisory Services

Unilogik plays the role of **solution integrator and engineering partner**.

### Key Contributions
- **Implementation of Red Hat AAP and Event-Driven Ansible**  
- **Integration of Dynatrace event streams with Ansible rulebooks**  
- **Design of automated remediation playbooks**  
- **Architecture workshops, hands-on enablement, and best-practices guidance**  
- **Operational readiness assessments** for enterprise automation adoption  

### Strategic Role
Unilogik ensures that the combined technologies are **designed, deployed, and optimized** to meet each client’s operational and compliance requirements. Their expertise bridges the gap between product capabilities and enterprise readiness.

## 5. Carahsoft: Distribution, Procurement, and Public-Sector Enablement

Carahsoft acts as the **central distribution and procurement partner**, especially for public sector organizations.

### Key Contributions
- **Authorized distributor for Red Hat and Dynatrace** in North America  
- **Procurement vehicles** (e.g., GSA, NASPO, state frameworks) that streamline acquisition  
- **Contract management and licensing optimization**  
- **Coordinated vendor engagement** to ensure cohesive solution delivery  

### Strategic Role
Carahsoft provides the **commercial and logistical framework** enabling organizations—especially government, education, and healthcare—to adopt the integrated solution efficiently and compliantly.

## 6. How the Four Partners Work Together

| Partner | Core Capability | Contribution to the Joint Solution |
|--------|----------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Red Hat** | Automation & Orchestration | Event-Driven Ansible, AAP, rulebooks, execution environments |
| **Dynatrace** | Observability & AI Insights | Alerts, problem events, Davis AI root-cause context |
| **Unilogik Systems** | Integration & Engineering | Solution design, implementation, enablement, workshops |
| **Carahsoft** | Procurement & Distribution | Licensing, contracts, public-sector procurement |

### End-to-End Workflow

1. **Dynatrace detects an anomaly**, performs AI root-cause analysis, and emits an event.  
2. **Event-Driven Ansible consumes the event**, evaluates rulebook conditions, and determines the correct remediation action.  
3. **Ansible executes automated remediation** (restart services, scale resources, generate incident tickets, update CMDBs, etc.).  
4. **Unilogik designs and operationalizes** this architecture to match customer environments.  
5. **Carahsoft supports procurement**, renewal, and long-term vendor coordination.

This creates a **closed-loop automation ecosystem**:  
**Intelligence → Rules → Automated Action → Continuous Optimization**

## 7. Benefits for Enterprise and Public-Sector Organizations

- **Reduced MTTR** via automated, AI-driven incident response  
- **Improved reliability** through consistent rule-based remediation  
- **Operational efficiency** with reduced manual toil  
- **Compliance and governance alignment**  
- **Scalability across hybrid, multi-cloud, and on-premise environments**  
- **Easier acquisition pathways** via Carahsoft’s contracting vehicles  
- **Hands-on adoption support** from Unilogik experts
